The AGDS Proseminar ... [description of the course]

Some important information:

- The course language is English.
- Classes will take place on Wednesdays 16.15 - 18.00. This is our presence time, use it for your communication with us. 
- There will not be a presence check. Nevertheless, in class you will have the opportunity to ask for help with your project hiccups and exchange ideas with other students. Attending the presentation and feedback sessions will be helpful to submit a successful project by the end of the seminar.
- Maximum capacity: 30 students.
- No email communication. Use your in person time.
- AGDS I is required. The concepts of this course will be used throughout the projects of the AGDS Proseminar, from coding and git to data wrangling and analysis.
- You will work on your own laptops, bring them to class.

## Course structure

- In groups of two, you will develop a data-intensive project. You will follow a reproducible workflow and the methods introduced in AGDS I. Familiarize yourself with the content in the [AGDS I book](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/).
- The project should relate to research and data in Geography and Climate Science.
- Open data should be used and at least two data types combined for the analysis.
- A set of example questions and data will be provided. Groups that decide to work on those will be able to start implementing the project earlier, therefore will also have earlier presentation dates.

*Project scope*
Your project must contain the following:
- Combine at least two data sources for analysis.
- Both a visualisation and a modelling component.
- Answer a question or verify a pattern in climate that you have studied or heard of (e.g. where warming is happening faster), all using data.
- Reason why your question/pattern is relevant and back up your hypothesis with theory.
- Expand data sources (outside of FLUXNET data from AGDS I). We provide a list of important data sources.
- Document the whole processing and analysis of the data, from data download to result interpretations. 
- Organize your code and data into a repository (with version control), that other students can easily reproduce. You will actually run each other's code, so make it understandable.
- Present your work with slides.

## Schedule

There will be in total 14 sessions, scheduled as follows:

## Evaluation

Evaluation will happen in the form of a report, followed by a presentation. Each pair of students will create a project and submit a GitHub repository, following the [AGDS example project](https://github.com/pepaaran/agds_proseminar_example), with all their code and a R Markdown as report. At the end of the semester, each pair will present their project to the rest of the class and exchange feedback.
