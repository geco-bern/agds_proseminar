# Logistics

## General information

- *Lead* : Prof. Benjamin Stocker; *Assistance* : Dr. Laura Marqués, Pepa Arán. - Geocomputation and Earth Observation group, GIUB, UniBe.
- The course language is English.
- Classes will take place on Wednesdays 16.15 - 18.00. This is our presence time, use it for your communication with us. 
- There will not be a presence check. Nevertheless, in class you will have the opportunity to ask for help with your project hiccups and exchange ideas with other students. Attending the presentation and feedback sessions will be helpful to submit a successful project by the end of the seminar.
- Maximum capacity: 30 students.
- No email communication. Use your in person time.
- Students are expected to master contents taught in *480094 Applied Geodata Science I*. The concepts of this course will be used throughout the projects of the Proseminar in Geocomputation and Earth Observation, from coding and using git to data wrangling and analysis.
- You will work on your own laptops, bring them to class.

## Course structure

- In groups of two, you will develop a data-intensive project. You will follow a reproducible workflow and the methods introduced in AGDS I. Familiarize yourself with the content in the [AGDS I book](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/).
- The project should relate to research and data in Geography and Climate Science.
- Open data should be used and at least two data types combined for the analysis.
- A set of example questions and data will be provided. Groups that decide to work on those will be able to start implementing the project earlier, therefore will also have earlier presentation dates.
- You should review the code from a group other than your own, try to run their code and provide them with feedback on the implementation and the project content itself. At the same time, you will receive feedback from another group, that you should implement in your own project.
- Active participation in the presentation sessions is expected, posing questions and providing feedback for a group's presentation.

## Schedule

There will be in total 14 sessions, scheduled as follows:

**Sessions 1-4** - Project scoping

- *Session 1 (20.09)* : Course logistics. Introduction of the example project. Forming project groups. Checkpoint R installations and GitHub repository.

> Before class, follow the instructions in the first chapter of the [AGDS I book](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/) to make sure that all the software needed for this course is installed and running. We will offer support in class, for those that encounter problems.

- *Session 2 (27.09)* : Introduction of public datasets and project ideas. Short tutorial on raster data.
- *Session 3 (04.10)* : Work on the project proposal in class and get feedback. Initial proposal due 24h after session 3 (Thursday 6pm).
- *Session 4 (11.10)* : Receive feedback from initial proposal and implement changes. Final proposal due after session 4 (Thursday 6pm).

**Sessions 5-9** - Project implementation

- *Session 5 (17.10)* : Presentation slot allocation. Project implementation. 
- *Session 6 (25.10)* : Project implementation.
- *Session 7 (01.11)* : Project implementation.
- *Session 8 (08.11)* : Project implementation.
- *Session 9 (15.11)* : Project implementation. Groups 1-3 exchange code with each other for feedback.

**Sessions 10-14** - Presentations

- *Session 10 (22.11)* : First half - Project implementation. Groups 4-6 exchange code with each other for feedback. Second half - Presentations of groups 1-3.
- *Session 11 (29.11)* : Presentations of groups 4-6. Groups 7-9 exchange code with each other for feedback.
- S*ession 12 (06.12)* : Presentations of groups 7-9. Groups 10-12 exchange code with each other for feedback.
- *Session 13 (13.12)* : Presentations of groups 10-12. Groups 13-15 exchange code with each other for feedback.
- *Session 14 (20.12)* : Presentations of groups 13-15.



## Evaluation

Evaluation will happen in the form of a report, followed by a presentation. Each pair of students will create a project and submit a GitHub repository, following the [AGDS example project](https://github.com/pepaaran/agds_proseminar_example), containing all code and a [RMarkdown](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/gettingstarted.html#rmarkdown) file as report. At the end of the semester, each pair will present their project to the rest of the class and exchange feedback. 

### Project scope

Your project must contain the following:

- Answer a question or verify a pattern in climate that you have studied or heard of (e.g. where warming is happening faster), all using data.
- Reason why your question/pattern is relevant and back up your hypothesis with theory.
- Cite and briefly discuss recent literature that exemplifies why your question is relevant.
- Write a formal project proposal, laying out the information from the first 3 points above, and reasoning data selection and potential modeling approaches and challenges.
- Combine at least two data sources for analysis.
- Include both a visualization and a modelling component.
- Expand data sources (outside of FLUXNET data from AGDS I). We provide a list of important data sources.
- Document the whole processing and analysis of the data, from data download to result interpretations. 
- Organize your code and data into a repository (with version control), that other students can easily reproduce. You will actually run each other's code, so make it understandable.
- Present your work with slides. Each group will have 10min for their presentation, followed by 5 min for a question round.

### Grading

- Students hand in their work in the form of a link, sent to Prof. B. Stocker, to a git repository that contains a project proposal (`README.md`) and code for a reproducible workflow (`vignettes/report.Rmd`). Furthermore, students will present their project in class.
<!-- - The contribution of each component to your grade is as follows: -->
<!--   - **Project proposal** (10%). -->
<!--   - **Report** (70%).  -->
<!--   - **Presentation** (20%). Your presentation should introduce and motivate your question, explain how you used data to answer it, and discuss the results of your analysis and modelling. Make sure that your slides are nicely formatted, clear and informative, and that both people in the team speak. -->
- For grading the report, we consider the following criteria:
  - **Reproducibility** (25%). Make sure your RMarkdown code is reproducible and generates a html document as intended. You can check this by letting a colleague clone your git repository and run your code on their machine. If it fails, it’s not reproducible, and you won’t get points for this aspect.
  - **Workspace organisation and code** (25%). Follow the principles for workspace organisation and coding as described in the AGDS book ([here](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/gettingstarted.html#wspmgmt) and [here](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/programmingprimers.html#programming-basics)).
  - **Presentation** (25%). This considers the appearance of the generated html document, its text and figures. Provide context, create at least three good data visualizations, and discuss your findings.
  - **Analysis and modelling** (25%). This considers the correctness of analysis and modelling implementations, and the reasonable application of methods.
- Each pair of students will hand in a single report. 
- Code duplications are not permitted and affected code will be graded with zero points for the respective part of the report.
- Reports cannot be re-submitted after having received the grades. Make sure all is reproducible before you submit.

### Note of caution

The use of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, for supporting code development should be considered with caution and is not permitted for writing report text. We are aware that LLMs can help solving technical tasks and the right use of LLMs for solving your problem is not discouraged. However, be aware that code produced by LLMs is not tested to be functional and error-free. Therefore, you have to understand what you get and verify and correct code with a view to your problem. Note that LLMs use text from various sources on the internet. Your report text must not contain verbatim copied text from unidentified sources. This would be considered plagiarism.
